This is the configuration directory for privleapd. You can define actions here
that users can then run using leaprun (or any other program that implements the
privleap protocol as a client).

Each configuration file in this directory must end in a .conf extension, and
the filename must consist only of the ASCII 7-bit characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9,
underscore (_), hyphen (-), and period (.). Files that do not adhere to this
requirement are silently ignored (including this README). Files in nested
directories are ignored. Symlinks to files are followed so long as the symlink
name adheres to the filename requirements. (The file used as the symlink's
target is not obligated to follow the filename requirements, since its filename
isn't used in any meaningful way by privleap.)

Each configuration file can define either *actions* or *persistent users*.
Actions are snippets of Bash code accompanied by metadata describing what user
the code should run as and what users are authorized to run that code.
Persistent users are users who have privleap comm sockets created for them when
privleap launches, and that can't have their sockets destroyed normally.

Each configuration file is formatted as follows:

* Lines starting with zero or more whitespace characters followed immediately
  by a `#` are comments. Other lines are interpreted as either headers, or
  key/value pairs, with the keys and values separated by a single equals (=)
  sign.
* Blank lines are ignored.
* Each action starts with a header formatted as "[action-name]". Actions may
  only contain the ASCII 7-bit characters a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underscore, hyphen, and
  period. The special value "[persistent-users]" cannot be used as an action
  name.
* The following keys are recognized:
    * Command= - The Bash code to run when this action is triggered.
    * AuthorizedUsers= - Comma-separated list of users that are permitted to
      trigger this action.
    * AuthorizedGroups= - Comma-separated list of groups that are permitted to
      trigger this action.
      * Note: If both "AuthorizedUsers" and "AuthorizedGroups" are unset or
        empty, any user may trigger the action. Setting either key will restrict
        the group of users that can run the action to whatever users are listed,
        and whatever users are in any groups that are listed. For instance, if
        "AuthorizedUsers=user1,user2" and "AuthorizedGroups=group1,group2" are
        set, then user1, user2, and any user in group1 or group2 can all trigger
        the action/
    * TargetUser= - The user that the action will run as. Defaults to "root".
    * TargetGroup= - The group that the action will run as. Defaults to "root".
* Each persistent user configuration section starts with the special header
  "[persistent-users]". Underneath this header, the only recognized key is
  "User=", followed by the name of the persistent user. An arbitrary number of
  these key-value pairs may exist underneath the header. It is not an error for
  the privleap configuration to contain multiple "[persistent-users]" sections,
  and it is not an error for the same user to be defined as a persistent user
  more than once. It *is* an error for a user that doesn't exist to be defined
  as a persistent user.

privleapd must be restarted for any changes to the configuration directory to
take effect. Note that if a configuration file contains a syntax error (for
instance, a non-header line with no = sign separating the key and value),
privleapd will fail to start.

An example config file might look something like:

    [echo-hello]
    Command=echo 'Hi!'

    [show-messagebus-id-info]
    Command=id
    AuthorizedGroup=sudo

    [persistent-users]
    User=root
    User=sdwdate
